Overview of VDA 
Veritone is a provider of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and solutions to the media and entertainment, legal and compliance, government, and more industries. 

Our proprietary aiWARE platform, much like a traditional operating system, provides a common, open software infrastructure that lets you build and use end-to-end, AI-powered solutions — from data ingestion to intelligent data analysis — accessible in the application of your choice. 

This approach combined with our proprietary orchestration technology, Conductor, makes it possible to quickly and accurately analyze massive amounts of diverse information — audio, video, image, text, and more — from multiple sources and formats to produce actionable intelligence in a faster, more scalable, and more cost-effective way than humans can.

We believe in the wisdom of the crowd. That’s why we built a machine learning ecosystem comprised of third-party cognitive engines and native, trainable machine learning models to achieve the breadth of capabilities and depth of specialization needed in AI applications to meet virtually any use case you might have. Today, our developer ecosystem supports over 30 different cognitive capabilities and counting within the speech, text, vision, biometrics, audio, data, and transformation cognitive classes.

If you’re looking for a sales channel for your AI software products, to add intelligent features to an existing application, or to leverage robust infrastructure for AI development and custom machine learning model training - Veritone’s aiWARE platform can help.

Developers Role in aiWARE
