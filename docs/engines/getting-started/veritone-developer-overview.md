# Engine Developers
## Tools
- Sandbox
  - The developer app sandbox is a safe and secure environment for engine developers to test their builds on sample files provided by Veritone or on files that they have uploaded themselves.
- Training Data
  - Engine developers have access to collections of data entities grouped as libraries. Developers can also upload additional data entities and create their own libraries.
- Benchmarking
  - The platform provides metrics to determine the peformance of an engine for a given dataset in comparison with ground truth and other engines. This allows the engine developer to identify shortcomings and re-train models to improve performance.
## Opportunities
 - Monetization
   - Receive payment upfront for use of your engines.
 - Competitive Positioning
   - Discover ways to differentiate your offering through feature and capability comparisons.
