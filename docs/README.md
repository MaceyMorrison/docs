# Veritone Overview

Veritone unlocks insights hidden within unstructured audio and video with the power of a single, SaaS-based, artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Pairing a portfolio of best-of-breed cognitive engines with an advanced suite of applications, Veritone delivers the value of artificial intelligence in a way that&rsquo;s accessible, understandable, and useful for a wide spectrum of customers &mdash; from individuals to large organizations. Every frame of video and second of audio can be searched for objects, license plates, faces, voices, brands, and more. With potent content ingestion, indexing, search, correlation, analytics, sharing, and collaboration capabilities, Veritone equips users with tools and insights to make smarter, more well-informed business decisions. <br /> <br />The Veritone Platform is designed to seamlessly integrate with external applications via a robust API. In addition, the Veritone Developer Application allows developers of custom applications, cognitive engines, and data sets/streams to build on the Veritone technology stack and provide their technology to customers through the Veritone Platform.

## Key Platform Features

### Ingestion
Veritone ingests both public and private content and media through various adapters from virtually any source, including user computers and network-accessible drives, RSS, Amazon Web Services, YouTube, Google Drive, Dropbox, Vimeo, and FTP. The architecture inherently supports simple and rapid addition of new ingestion adapters. You can even write your own.

### Developer Platform and Ecosystem

The Veritone Developer Application (VDA) allows developers to bring their ideas to life. The VDA connects developers with resources to create, submit, and deploy custom adapters, applications, cognitive engines, and data products into Veritone&rsquo;s architecture.

### A Broad and Growing Cognitive Spectrum

Veritone unlocks unique insights from the sea of unstructured data with a rich and optimized portfolio of cognitive engines. Customers can employ multiple AI engines &mdash; both within the same category and across different categories &mdash; at high rates of cognition. Veritone&rsquo;s hundreds of production engines encompass seven cognitive classes and more than 50 categories, including NLP, Computer Vision, Face Recognition, Sentiment, Translation, Audio Fingerprinting, Geolocation, and Content Moderation.

<h3><strong>Proprietary Conductor</strong><sup><strong>TM</strong></sup><strong> Orchestration</strong></h3>

Proprietary Veritone Conductor technology optimizes the cognitive engine selection process by periodically evaluating the cost, speed, and accuracy of each engine to improve results and achieve higher levels of cognition. It orchestrates and intelligently routes media to the most appropriate cognitive engines within chosen engine classes to generate the best results.

### A Suite of Proprietary Applications

Veritones suite of native applications to enable users to ingest, process, index, manage, search, and share their cognitively-enriched content.

### Philosophy of Open Data

This is a central tenet of the Veritone value proposition, embracing the philosophy of openly sharing the world&rsquo;s data to accelerate the global pace of machine learning via accessible and ever growing training data sets.

### Flexible Deployment Models

The Veritone Platform offers a variety of implementation and media storage options to match the technical environment and security requirements of clients. Current deployment options include Amazon Web Services (AWS), AWS Government, Microsoft Azure Government in the United States, plus AWS in the United Kingdom. We also offer a hybrid on-premise cloud version of our award-winning solution, and a fully on-premise cognition and API suite.

### Process Data in Real-time

Veritone now supports real-time ingestion and processing of content. Users can stream live content through the platform, run cognitive engines on the content, and get the results back immediately, as the content continues to stream.

### Expand Your Insights with Structured Data

Veritone now allows you to ingest structured data, either as standalone content or to match up with and enhance another data source. Ingest the contents of your private database or use a third-party data feed. Use text data to correlate with what's being shown in a video by time. The possibilities are within reach.

### Future-Proof and Ever-Evolving

The Veritone ecosystem of best-of-breed AI cognitive engines in a single platform eliminates the need for businesses, agencies, and individuals to select one vendor from the landscape of thousands of engines. This effectively future-proofs AI technology choices and ensures timely and common access to the latest AI advances.


## Veritone Application Suite

Veritone&rsquo;s suite of powerful AI applications enables users to organize, manage, search, analyze, and extend their cognitively-enriched content. The Platform includes the following native, general-purpose AI applications:

#### CMS
Veritone CMS (Content Management System) is used to ingest/add media, delete media, define cognitive workflows, process new or previously processed media with additional artificial intelligence engines, organize ingested media, check the status of artificial intelligence engine execution, and view summary statistics for all ingested media.

#### Discovery

Veritone Discovery allows users to create and execute direct searches against cognitive engine output, either through predefined programmatic queries (called Watchlists) or by ad-hoc searches. Permission-controlled actions including downloading media clips, editing cognitive metadata, and sharing search results are also enabled within the application.

#### Collections

Veritone Collections presents groupings of search results or Watchlists in shareable units called Collections. Users and organizations can extend and amplify their media by customizing and sharing Collections and Clips via embedded widget, social media, or email. &nbsp;&nbsp;

#### Analytics

Veritione Analytics features a set of dashboards that provide metrics on top-valued reporting measures and tools, allowing users to intuitively interact with and explore their data. &nbsp;Currently embedded in Discovery App.

#### Admin

Veritone Admin is used to establish, monitor, and manage account configurations, such as user permissions and cognitive workflows.

#### Library

Veritone Library provides capabilities for creating a custom database of faces to easily recognize people in video files. Veritone Library also includes a set of pre-defined libraries with more than 10,000 famous faces from around the world, including athletes, TV/news personalities, celebrities, and foreign dignitaries.

#### Developer

Veritone Developer is a self-service environment where registered developers can access tools, documentation, APIs to build and submit their AI applications, ingestion engines, cognitive engines or data schemas for consideration. We'll be continuing to add new features to the Veritone Developer application over time, and you can expect to see transparent usage and revenue reporting, competitive benchmarking, and other key performance indicators added in the coming months.
